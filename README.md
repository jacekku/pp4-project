# PP4-project aka. finish-in-one-week-and-you-don't-have-to-do-anything-the-entire-semester project

At the start of the semester at the university, learning about databases and connecting them to a website (PostgreSQL and PHP), our teacher made clear that if somebody had a project that already satisfied the requirements (Database, Communication with said database via code, some other stuff) then that project could be graded early and that would be our final grade. The deadline was next week. So I set out to create a project satisfying the criteria, a chat room with users. Users could register and passwords would be hashed + salted and stored in the DB. Then those users could enter a chatroom where they could see messages from all the other users. 

The final project satisfied the grading criteria and I passed one week after starting the semester.
